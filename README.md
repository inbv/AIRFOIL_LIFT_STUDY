# AIRFOIL_LIFT_STUDY

## What is it?

This code is the one I used and/or created for my International Baccalaureate Extended Essay in Physics, where I   
compare the lift force of an airfoil depending on the ratio between its top and bottom thicknesses, relative to the chord.   
It was a very interesting project, and a good way for me to learn/imporve on my Octave scripting, as it's a very powerful tool I want to use in future projects.

## The Code
### Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
For this project, I used an Arduino Uno, so I used a [pre-existing code](https://circuits4you.com/2016/11/25/hx711-arduino-load-cell/) and modified it to my needs. I am not very strong in Arduino yet, so this was the most effective solution, but I'm hoping to improve through other projects, as Arduino is a great tool for many different types of projects. 

### Octave Scripting
Apart from Arduino IDE code, I also used the multi-tool scripting software Octave, which I used to visualize and process my data. For this code, I learned with the help of my father, and then wrote many different version of the code until it fit my needs and outputted a good result.
